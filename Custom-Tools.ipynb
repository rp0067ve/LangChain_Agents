Unlike the previous generations of Baleno when it was offered as a sedan, wagon, or a 3-door hatchback, the model sold since 2015 is exclusively offered as a 5-door hatchback.\n",

The first-generation model is heavily based on the Swift while the second-generation model introduced in 2018 is made larger and based on the HEARTECT platform. A crossover-styled version was introduced in 2019 as a separate model called the Suzuki XL6 in India and Suzuki XL7 for worldwide markets. The largest markets for the Ertiga are India and Indonesia, where the model is mainly manufactured. The vehicle has also been exported to other South Asian and Southeast Asian markets, along with several markets in Africa, Middle East, Pacific Islands, Caribbean and Latin America.\n",
      "The Ertiga has been rebadged by various carmakers throughout its history. The first-generation model was sold in Indonesia through Mazda dealership network by an OEM agreement as the Mazda VX-1 from 2013 until 2017, and was assembled and sold in Malaysia by Proton as the Proton Ertiga from 2016 until 2019. The second-generation model is also sold by Toyota as the Toyota Rumion since 2021.\n",
      "The name \"Ertiga\" is coined from \"R-tiga\", a pronunciation of \"R3\" in Indonesian where \"tiga\" means \"three\" while \"R\" stands for \"row\", referencing its three-row seating capacity.\n",

      "Summary: Pearl Harbor is an American lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. It was often visited by the Naval fleet of the United States, before it was acquired from the Hawaiian Kingdom by the U.S. with the signing of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands are now a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941, led the United States to declare war on the Empire of Japan, making the attack on Pearl Harbor the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.\n",

      "Page: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n",
      "Summary: The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States against the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, just before 8:00 a.m. (local time) on Sunday, December 7, 1941. The United States was a neutral country at the time; the attack led the U.S. to formally enter World War II on the side of the Allies the following day. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning.The attack was preceded by months of negotiations between the United States and Japan over the future of the Pacific. Japanese demands included that the United States end its sanctions against Japan, cease aiding China in the Second Sino-Japanese war, and allow Japan to access the resources of the Dutch East Indies. Anticipating a negative response, Japan sent out its naval attack groups in November 1941 just prior to receiving the Hull note—the United States demand that Japan withdraw from China and French Indochina. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action. Its aim was to prevent the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and those of the United States. Over the course of seven hours, there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time (6:18 p.m. GMT). The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight United States Navy battleships present, all were damaged and four were sunk. All but USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. More than 180 US aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded, making it the deadliest event ever recorded in Hawaii. Important base installations, such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 129 servicemen killed. Kazuo Sakamaki, the commanding officer of one of the submarines, was captured.\n",
      "Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire later that day (December 8 in Tokyo), but the declarations were not delivered until the following day. The British government declared war on Japan immediately after learning that their territory had also been attacked, while the following day (December 8), the United States Congress declared war on Japan. On December 11, though they had no formal obligation to do so under the Tripartite Pact\u001b[0m\n",
